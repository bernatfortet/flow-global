Recognizing that the magnificence of a woman is reflected by the whole community from which she gathers support to thrive, we warmly welcome guests of any gender for community events and programs. </p><p>We actively seek a membership of diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. As a club with a strong social commitment, we prioritize access and impact through a robust and anonymously sponsored membership fund.

The Flow team collaborates with each member as she nourishes and <strong>unleashes her own abilities</strong> through our workshops, lectures, study groups, sisterhoods and mentoring. It is our belief that each woman can create her unique and individual path toward fulfillment and accomplishment. We are simply here to help.</p><div class="more"><p>We focus on three areas at Flow Global on behalf of our members: money, selfhood and social impact. Our intake process begins with a deep discovery and a conversation about needs, aspirations and goals. Along with an agenda for learning and skill-building, we assist our member in the creation of a dedicated sisterhood. The sisterhood reinforces and supports her new insight and learning. This leads to thoughtful, heartfelt action: the key to fulfillment.</p><p>Our members' learning paths are informed by Flow Doyennes - notable women trailblazers and experts who collaborate with Flow leadership as temporary faculty in eighteen-month paid fellowships. As a cohort,  Flow Doyennes inform the new member discovery/intake process, design curricula, recommend visiting contributors and work together to advance the cause of supporting women. Once a year the Flow Doyennes present together at a summit on issues pertaining to their work as well as emerging global issues for women. We take pride in broadcasting our doyennes' relevant articles, lectures, online and podcast contributions as well as media events. As our Doyenne program is based on rotating positions, the organization is consistently celebrating new contributions while updating curricula and providing fresh perspectives.</p></div><div class="more-button">More</div></div></div><div class="parallax-window r2"></div><div class="text-block"><div class="text"><p>We believe that <strong>fulfilled and empowered women</strong> have the key to unlock our largest capacity for progress - progress that both enriches women’s own lives and enlivens their communities. 					</p><div class="more"><p>Flow Global, Inc. is created with principle and purpose in its DNA.
