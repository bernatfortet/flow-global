					h2 The Palace of Fine Arts
					p The Arcadium SF is joyously working to win the bid for the long term lease of the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco. You can <a href="#Join">join our campaign here</a>.
					p Designed by Bernard Maybeck in 1915 after the earthquake of 1906, The Palace of Fine Arts was and is the jewel of the city of San Francisco, representing not just a moment for technological innovation but for real cultural gains and, for the return of beauty delivered out of the flames of literal destruction.
					img(src="images/pofa_mosaic.jpg")
					p Working with a talented team of local architects and designers, we are committed to restoring and augmenting this iconic space to its rightful place as an enriched, engaging and enchanting environment for all visitors.
