					p The Arcadium San Francisco is joyously working to win the bid for the long term lease of the Palace of Fine Arts. You can <a href="#Join">join our campaign here</a>.
					p Designed by Bernard Maybeck in 1915 after the earthquake of 1906, the Palace of Fine Arts was and is the Jewel of the City of San Francisco, representing not just a moment for technological innovation but for real cultural gains and for the return of beauty delivered out of the flames of literal destruction.

					p.orange Working with a talented team of local architects and designers, we are committed to restoring and enlivening this iconic space to serve as an enriched, engaging and enchanting environment for all visitors.
