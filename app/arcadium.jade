						p Community engagement and participation is the bedrock principle of our endeavor. It is neither an obligation, nor a platitude. Instead it is our calling, privilege and joy.

Ongoing engagement with our communities of visitors and vendors will ensure that the variety and quality of our programming exceed expectations. And during our construction phase, a Direct Public Offering will provide opportunity for financial involvement at a low minimum investment threshold.
