					p We believe that <strong>fulfilled and empowered women</strong> have the key to unlock our largest capacity for progress - progress that both enriches women’s own lives and enlivens their communities.

						p We are breaking the mold.
						p Flow Global, Inc. is created with principle and purpose in its DNA. Our structure is a non-profit organization (5013c), from which we operate global non-profit centers. Our first chapter, in San Francisco, will contain a cooperative club, a non-profit cultural center, and a for-profit market hall for services and goods—each propelled by one consistent social mission and informed by several core, rooted principles:
						p 
							li 1. We view organizations as living beings separate from and still including the contributions of the wonderful humans guiding them.
							li 2. We uphold a stewardship model over an ownership model and actively work toward healthy financial self-sufficiency over dependence and debt for our organization.
							li 3. Demonstrating societal contribution is the highest aspiration of our organization.
							li 4. Flow Global, Inc. does not exist in order to make specific people and/or shareholders wealthy at the expensive of its goals, mission or members.
						p We value:
							li 1. Thoughtful, heartfelt action.
							li 2. Diversity of ideas and people.
							li 3. Clear lines of responsibility.
							li 4. A joyous, creative and soulful work environment.
							li 5. Salutogenic practices that include: decoupling authority from remuneration, intrinsically sourced goals, shared rewards, transparency in communication, small teams.

					p We will collaborate with each member as she recognizes, nourishes and <strong>unleashes her own abilities in progressive steps</strong> with her selection of workshops, lectures, study groups and mentoring for her unique path of fulfillment and accomplishment.
					.more
						p We engage our member on her relationship to money, self-development and social impact --which leads to a deep discovery. The discovery leads her to name her goals. The goals lead her to create a learning path and dedicated sisterhood. The sisterhood reinforces and supports her new insight and learning. This leads to thoughtful, heartfelt action: the key to fulfillment.
						p Our members' learning paths are informed by Flow Doyenne - notable women trailblazers who will collaborate with Flow leadership as temporary faculty. Each doyenne position is an eighteen-month paid fellowship corresponding to the fifteen categories in the Flow Care program. The doyenne inform the new member discovery/intake process, set parameters for curricula, recruit additional contractors for our course catalogue and work together on a single global gender cause of their choosing. Collectively and individually, the contributions of our doyenne will be broadcast. Flow will publish their relevant articles and publicize their lectures, online contributions and media events. As our doyenne program is based on rotating positions, the organization is consistently celebrating women's contributions while updating curricula and providing fresh perspectives.
