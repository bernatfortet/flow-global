						p Flow Global will offer membership to anyone who identifies as woman of age 18 and over. Recognizing that the magnificence of a woman is reflected by the whole community from which she gathers support to thrive, we warmly welcome guests of any gender for community events and programs. 

						p We actively seek a membership of diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. As a club with a strong social commitment, we prioritize access and impact through a robust and anonymously sponsored membership fund. In ten years we envision Flow chapters spanning six continents linking millions of women to each other, to local and to global causes.

					p We empower each of our members to discover where her capabilities and skills might need focus, strengthening or celebrating. The Flow team collaborates with each member as she nourishes and <strong>unleashes her own abilities</strong> through our workshops, lectures, study groups, sisterhoods and mentoring. It is our belief that each woman can create her unique and individual path toward fulfillment and accomplishment. We are simply here to help.

						p We focus on three areas at Flow Global on behalf of our members: money, selfhood and social impact. Our intake process begins with a deep discovery and a conversation about needs, aspirations and goals. Along with an agenda for learning and skill-building, we assist our member in the creation of a dedicated sisterhood. The sisterhood reinforces and supports her new insight and learning. This leads to thoughtful, heartfelt action: the key to fulfillment.
						p Our members' learning paths are informed by Flow Doyennes - notable women trailblazers and experts who collaborate with Flow leadership as temporary faculty in eighteen-month paid fellowships. As a cohort,  Flow Doyennes inform the new member discovery/intake process, design curricula, recommend visiting contributors and work together to advance the cause of supporting women. Once a year the Flow Doyennes present together at a summit on issues pertaining to their work as well as emerging global issues for women. We take pride in broadcasting our doyennes' relevant articles, lectures, online and podcast contributions as well as media events. As our Doyenne program is based on rotating positions, the organization is consistently celebrating new contributions while updating curricula and providing fresh perspectives.

						p Flow Global, Inc. is created with principle and purpose in its DNA. Our structure is a non-profit organization (5013c), from which we will operate global non-profit chapters, beginning in San Francisco. Flow Global Inc. is also a sister organization to a mission-driven for-profit business whose aim is to create centers that promote community, culture, commerce and care.

						p Our organization and its chapters are informed by several core and rooted principles:
						p 
							li We view organizations as living beings separate from and still including the contributions of the wonderful humans guiding them.
							li We uphold a stewardship model over an ownership model and actively work toward healthy financial self-sufficiency over dependence and debt.
							li Demonstrating societal contribution is the highest aspiration of our organization.
							li Flow Global, Inc. does not exist in order to make individuals wealthy at the expense of its goals, mission or members.
						p We value:

							li Thoughtful, heartfelt action.
							li Diversity of ideas and people.
							li Clear lines of responsibility.
							li A joyous, creative and soulful work environment.

						p <strong>Mirran Raphaely</strong> feels a relentless calling to launch Flow Global. In her sixteen years helping to build the renowned and forerunning Dr.Hauschka Skin Care brand, and specifically seven as its US CEO, she developed ideas, methods, products and teams that view the world differently and have proven it through successful contribution. From her childhood years on a remote farm in Africa, to her university activism, to her various professional accomplishments, Mirran perpetually finds herself celebrating the spirit of human striving, our sacred natural world and the magic of organizations working passionately to make a difference for the planet and her inhabitants.

						p <strong>Stephanie Ciancio</strong> comes from unlikely mangrove roots in sunny south Florida. She is a people person and a student of culture and societies dedicated to love, beauty, and transformation. Her meandering path of humanistic studies, fashion design, ESL teaching and sustainable business has circumnavigated the globe from Montreal, to London, to Tokyo and to her new hometown San Francisco. She holds an MBA from Presidio Graduate School and has worked with numerous urban-focused startups as a team manager and community builder. She envisions a new norm of women smiling at each other on sidewalks, knowing even before they’ve met that they’re in on something revolutionary.
						
						p <strong>Bec Chapin</strong> creates space for people to thrive in community. She has spent the past 5 years as a professional builder and executive, using pre-fab and sustainable construction as a lever for change in the world. Bec is an alumnae of Mount Holyoke women’s college, a sailor, a certified marine engineer, and a third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. This foundation has built for her the perspective, awareness and self assurance to nurture the best in humanity.

						p <strong>Troy Carter</strong> is a joy-filled soul and explorer who divides his time between an earthly paradise on Cortes Island, British Columbia, and making manifest his utopian dreams for human culture throughout the world. He holds a degree in economics from Stanford University, and envisions a paradigm shift in the balance of feminine and masculine energy, economic livelihoods that support profound meaning and self-realization, and the evolution of human communication. After 4,000 years of excessively yang society, he finds it appropriate that the midwife for Flow is a man.
